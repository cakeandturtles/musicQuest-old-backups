short game, probably about the length of portal or VVVVVV

The three longterm goals::
-Master your musical talents
-Find the source of the voice of pure melodic emotion
-Quell the death and destruction caused by the voids


-Each level should be structured around these three longterm goals, both gameplay/story wise
-While tied to the three goals, the individual levels should be distinct enough to give interesting variety


=========================================================================================================
INTRO::

-Gameplay: Learn basic running and chord smashes. On piano.
-Story: The beautiful voice awakes you in and leads you to the Noise. Then the voice dissipates and the screen blackens out 
-Architecture: Inside your tree house at night, lead to the tree top where the Noise looms ominously over.

-AND THEN INTRO TUTORIAL LEVEL PLEASE



THEN there is an ambient overworld from which you can explore and pick from five different levels
