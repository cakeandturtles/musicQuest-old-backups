Musical Game Documentation Roughie::

-Sudden Contrast

-Life would be very dull without music. Music is the magic of life...?

-Player simueltaneously controls the ambience and the melody (environment/avatar) but how are we going to do, let alone balance this?

-Various ambience sounds and animal sounds change depending on the current key of the 	composition the player is making or go along with the rhthym or anything like that

-Cycle of day/night = biocircadian rhythms = cycle of human emotions = cycles/swells in 	music

-Mix coralineesque feeling with the music game.
	-The feeling of exploration like a child and just playing around learning the 	world around you can very well translate to the same experience we're giving 	players with the gameplay ideas already in place.

-Monsters/beasts that flash light in the dark when they get hit/play notes/ or something 	like that... pretty lights in the dark (bioluminesence...?)

-How is accompaniment work? Little animals or allies that follow you around and sort of 	kind of help but are mostly just motivational support?

-Important!!!: Instead of a passive designed mode of difficulty dynamicness: implement DDA choices as a normal part of the gameplay that players will eventually grow used to and subconsciously take advantage of for controlling difficulty (inspired by flOw in games)... gives player more control anyways

-Balance ambient attack and and melodious attacks.










--Player is chasing after the beautiful melodious voice (sung by Ashley Moon) and controls all the blips and bangs, has to find his own (semi-robotic) voice to save her and make pretty things
