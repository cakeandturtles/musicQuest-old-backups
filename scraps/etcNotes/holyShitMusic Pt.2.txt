Music: 
-Pitch of notes
-Duration of notes
-Duration of rest (negative space will be an important factor)
-Syncopation and rhythms
-Simple/Compound or Odd meter
-ACCIDENTALS!!!
-Major vs. Minor scales/chords
-CHORDS!!! OH MY GOD CHORDS! 
    -Could combo chords (several buttons pressed) with runs of smaller notes
    -Power chords (only two notes?)
                            -Do different major keys have different sounds/feels do you think?
    -Chord progression...?
    
-Circular behavior of notes

-Phrases and cadences.
    -Authentic vs. imperfect cadences... DECEPTIVE CADENCES and Plagic cadences.





-TENSION vs. RESOLUTION
    THIS IS GOING TO BE A REALLY REALLY REALLY BIGGY for conflict in the game.
