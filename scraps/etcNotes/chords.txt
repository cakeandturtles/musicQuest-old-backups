monophonic texture — a single melody without accompaniment

- I hear you requested a melody that could be played on the piano using one finger.


Video game background music, like the pieces we’ve analyzed so far, loops indefinitely. This structure requires that they be harmonically open — in other words, they end on a dominant chord (or something similarly unresolved) so that the harmonic progression can cycle back to the beginning. The warp songs, by contrast, are self-contained and have full cadences at the end.

quarter note, quarter note, eighth eighth eighth, (think of a way to let player do different rhythmic runs for awesomeness)

-Objectives::
	-More importance of combos:: (keep a combo meter that rises above your head, when you finish your combo what does the combo meter do?)




-Weapon Mechanics::
	-Violin rapier:: attacks are quicker (can hit up to sixteenth notes during a beat) but harder to hit to beat
